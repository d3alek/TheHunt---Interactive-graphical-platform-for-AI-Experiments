For instance, the example Prey eats as much as it can while hiding from the user who wields a net and looks forward to catch it.\r\n\r\nThis leads to the other purpose - to be a fun Android game/an interesting Live Wallpaper.\r\n\r\nFeel free to use it for whatever comes to mind, and tell me about it! :-)\r\n\r\nMain features\r\n--------------------\r\n  * **Graphics engine**\r\n    * Written from scratch on top of OpenGL ES 2\r\n    * Sprites and Shapes abstractions for more intuitive and easy graphics creation and manipulation\r\n  * **Scrollable world**\r\n    * Ecosystem featuring Currents and Algae\r\n    * Event system which the Agent can use to understand it’s surroundings\r\n    * Tools abstraction as means for the user to modify the environment\r\n      * CatchNet tool implemented which releases a net that can catch the Agent\r\n  * **Agent**\r\n    * Example agent (Prey), the main character in the game and live wallpaper, so far always hungry and cowardly\r\n    * Agent interface for easy implementation of various other agents \r\n\r\n\r\nCurrent issues - many\r\n--------------------------------\r\n  * Documentation is non existent - the code is supposed to be as readable as possible though. Still, a priority.\r\n  * Some game features are missing, like a HUD. As soon as these are implemented I will release the game to the Android Market for all to enjoy\r\n  * Some parts of the code require major refactoring\r\n\r\n\r\nProject structure\r\n-------------------------\r\n  * *d3kod.graphics* \r\n    * Graphics engine on OpenGL ES 2.0\r\n    * Supports both Application and Live Wallpaper modes\r\n  * *d3kod.thehunt.world*\r\n    * Interactive graphical environment\r\n    * *events.* * - Agent Senses supported: Algae, At, Current, Food, Light, Noise\r\n  * *d3kod.thehunt.agent*\r\n    * Agent - Agent Template\r\n    * *prey.* * - Agent example and main character in the game/live wallpaper\r\n  * *d3kod.thehunt*\r\n    * Main Application context\r\n    * Android application Activity, GLSurfaceView and Dialogs \r\n  * *d3kod.thehunt.livewallpaper*\r\n    * Android Live Wallpaper Activity and GLSurfaceView\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-26306740-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
